```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If, while developing this package, you change the installed packages, please update the environment file using

```
pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
```

## VSCode specific setup
